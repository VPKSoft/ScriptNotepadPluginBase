## The SUO package
The SUO stands for [unofficial.ScintillaNET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/unofficial.ScintillaNET/) dependency which is updated with the recent pull requests build from this [ScintillaNET fork](https://github.com/VPKSoft/ScintillaNET) from the original [ScintillaNET](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET). The fork was made to try to keep up with the changes to the code base suggested by users as the official version is getting outdated for unknown reason(s) ðŸ™„.
